# Backend

This project uses **Prisma ORM** with **PostgreSQL** to manage the backend and database. The data model was built with extensibility in mind â€” for instance, it includes a `password` field, enabling future iterations with user authentication and account creation.

To enable real-time communication, the application integrates **WebSockets**. It also features an **AI-powered system** that rewrites questions dynamically based on user preferences.

The entire backend is deployed on **AWS**, with **Nginx** configured as a reverse proxy to ensure high performance in production.
